Bayesian optimization is a **global optimization** strategy for **black-box** and **expensive-to-evaluate** functions.
Generic Bayesian optimization follows these steps:

#. Build a **surrogate function** with historical inputs and their observations.
#. Compute and maximize an **acquisition function**, defined by the outputs of surrogate function.
#. Observe the **maximizer** of acquisition function from a true objective function.
#. Accumulate the maximizer and its observation.

This project helps us to execute this Bayesian optimization procedure.
In particular, **Gaussian process regression** is used as a surrogate function,
and various acquisition functions such as **probability improvement**, **expected improvement**, and **Gaussian process upper confidence bound** are included in this project.
